            <p>Transformers were originally introduced to take on challenges faced in tasks like language modelling and machine translation. 
                Before the introduction of Transformers the then SOTA methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), recurrent neural network (RNN) were ignorantly sequential in nature which posed challenges in handling long sequences due to memory constrains of hardware. 
                The Transformers were introduced as an approach that only uses self-attention, the absence of recurrence allowed for significant improvements in parallelisation. 
                For example, in natural language processing tasks, architectures like GPT-4 can handle entire paragraphs or documents with thousands of tokens, maintaining context and coherence across long sequences, which was previously a significant limitation in earlier models like RNNs or LSTMs.</p>

            <p>The success of transformers in natural language tasks inspired researchers at Google Brain research team to apply them to computer vision tasks, such as image classification. 
                At that time, convolutional neural networks (CNN) was the dominant approach to tackle computer vision tasks. 
                Vision transformers see very differently from CNNs. CNN stats with very low-level local information and gradually build up more global structures in deeper layers, ViT already have global information at the earliest layer because of global self-attention. 
                As pithily summarized in a Quanta article, “If a CNN’s approach is like starting at a single pixel and zooming out, a transformer slowly brings the whole fuzzy image into focus.”.
