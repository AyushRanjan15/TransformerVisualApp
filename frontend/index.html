        <p>Vision Transformers (ViT) has recently emerged as a competitive alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are currently state-of-the-art (SOTA) in different image recognition computer vision tasks. ViT models outperform the current SOTA CNNs by almost x4 in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</p>
        <p>Transformer models have become the de facto status quo in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For example, the popular ChatGPT AI chatbot is a transformer-based language model. Specifically, it is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. This uses self-attention mechanisms to model the dependencies between words in a text.</p>
        <p>In computer vision research, there has recently been a rise in interest in Vision Transformer (ViTs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs).</p>
